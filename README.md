## Project Description

This project is a frontend development challenge based on the 3-Column Preview Card Component. The primary goal of this challenge is to build a responsive card component with hover styles for interactive elements.

This challenge is perfect if you're just getting started. The shift between the layouts will be a nice test if you're new to building responsive projects.

## Features
